# Take Note of This

## Description

Build an app to take and save notes as needed using an Express.js server and routes to serve the front and back ends. Landing page shows a 'Get Started' button which if pressed will show any notes previously written and saved, as well as an option to write a new note by pressing the '+' icon in the top right.

## Overview of Work Done

* Install node.js applications needed, and establish the dependencies and middleware.

* Write the 'GET' and 'POST' routes and test them using the Insomnia testing and debugging client.

* Write a 'listen' callback to determine an exact destination. 

* Write the 'GET' routes for the html pages.

* Write the 'delete' method for notes that are no longer needed.
